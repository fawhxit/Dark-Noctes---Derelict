RELEASE CRUNCH:

Notes to self: Ok, tired of trying to do too much etc. Let's just get this thing up on Steam.
Let's just get a sufficent amount of audio logs done and implemented, got the first 3 of "Mark Henson"
done, want to add several more.

Finish Adding Audio Logs; Record More, 3/? Recorded so far; 3/3 Implemented
	- Audio Logs @ Trail3, Bunker4, Couryard0
	- Audio Logs Normalized to ~-6(R) and -18(L) in Audacity

Playthrough a couple times to iron out kinks and quirks.

Fix the damn tree spawns, they're blocking too much of the view damn it.

Let's make it to where "Previous/Back" nodes are automatically found and also
that found nodes are highlighted in some way to make navigation less tedious.

Make sure monster isn't glitching out.

Do Release.

Disregard "Old Notes" for now

OLD NOTES
_________________________


RECENT FOCUS:

Mess with BG image blend, blend_off darker? Looks good with lightening flashes but makes scenes too dark...
	- Use 2 layers of BG and subtract with flashlight to show BG layer w/ normal lighting w/ flashlight?
	- Let's just remove the interior fog and reduce the outdoors fog, it's annoying to look at

Adjust lane BG objects to be 20% inside edges at most; closer to viewer; don't get as small when farther

Finish implementing Crowbar and Attack/Hit Logic w/ sfx

oFX Object SFX Partially broken when added in emitter,
	keycard scanners dont work now (easy fix)

Monster shouldn't be in Menu or End Screen
	- 0% - Though I kinda like it in the end screen to dance around

Monster behavior when in scene and player moves to another scene.
	- 80% - Monster moves 67% of scene width to the side when moving scenes;

Monster should have delay between appearances when destroyed as to not
	"spam spawn" based on difficulty
	- 75% - Just need a timer for this (easy)

Show keycard "Action"
	- 50% - Sprite Ready; Make Object that shows action sprite during Accept FX

Make the monster increasingly active and aggressive
	- 90% - Monster Kills Nicely; Difficulty Progresses;
		Spawns Everywhere; Trigger kill if performing action near it

Add more mind fuckery sounds and other visual psych-outs
	- 50% - New Sounds Processed; Some Added; Add More

Make an ending and restart when killed instead of just exiting game
	- 0% - Might be tricky

Add Random Keycards and Doors to section off each area.

Add a random code to find and use to unlock vehicle depot from security tower
	- 25% - Random Code Generated; Use Security Tower Terminal to Unlock Depot

	crowbar which doesnt break and can deter the monster temporarily
	- 25% - Stick looks good!; Add Crowbar; Add Hit Action
